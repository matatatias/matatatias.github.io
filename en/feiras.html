				<h1><a href='../index.html'>Matias Peruyera</a></h1>
				
				<p class="about-1">I’d call myself a graphic designer, but that would leave out many other skills in editing, writing, infographics, data visualization, typography, programming, illustration, and perhaps the main one: knowing how to identify the best resource for each situation. I absolutely love print, but I'm also fascinated with the possibilities of interactive media.</p>

						<p class="gravata">The explanation of an innovative service is an important part of itself, as well as information and content to make better use of it. In these projects I took care of both visuals and writing.</p>

					  <h3>Tips for fairs in Brazil</h3>
  							<p>The client, who handles international logistics, wanted to promote <a href="space-samples.html">his services</a>. He had the idea of creating a brochure for print and digital distribution with tips for Chinese entrepreneurs and employees to be more successful at trade fairs in Brazil, pointing out habits that could be interpreted as a lack of interest – or even rudeness – by potential Brazilian customers. From the text provided by the client, I grouped the tips by subject, rewrote the copy, drew the illustrations and designed the brochure in a way that it could be printed in home and office printers. Afterwards, a Mandarin version was made. I researched how Chinese people usually represent themselves in illustrations, to avoid Western stereotypes.</p>
