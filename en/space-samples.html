				<p class="about-1">I’d call myself a graphic designer, but that would leave out many other skills in editing, writing, infographics, data visualization, typography, programming, illustration, and perhaps the main one: knowing how to identify the best resource for each situation. I absolutely love print, but I'm also fascinated with the possibilities of interactive media.</p>

							<h3>Space Samples</h3>
							<p>
Space Samples is a service for those who import products from China and want to have a showroom in a strategic location at a low cost. The idea is good, but it needed to be explained well.							</p>				
							<p><img src="../../images/spacesamples-0.png"></p>
							<p>
There were some exchanges of emails and sketches until reaching the final explanation, which had versions for each medium that would be used – email, mobile, print. I wrote the copy, and made infographics and illustrations.							</p>


							<p><img src="../../images/spacesamples-1.jpg"></p>
							<p>
I started editing the text the client had sent me. Then, the sketches began to adjust the visual form of the explanation and the tone of the illustrations.							</p>
							<p><img src="../../images/spacesamples-3.jpg"></p>
							<p>
I also made maps and infographics to explain the features of the company's facilities.							</p>
