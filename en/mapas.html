				<p class="about-1">I’d call myself a graphic designer, but that would leave out many other skills in editing, writing, infographics, data visualization, typography, programming, illustration, and perhaps the main one: knowing how to identify the best resource for each situation. I absolutely love print, but I'm also fascinated with the possibilities of interactive media.</p>

					  <h3>Maps</h3>
							<p>Some examples of maps I made. An old passion that became an important part of my professional life.</p>
							<h4>África do Sul - Copa do Mundo 2010</h4>
							<p>This example is an infographic that collects some data about South Africa, on the occasion of the World Cup, for the  Gazeta do Povo newspaper. The map, created with open resources such as satellite images and shapefiles, shows the relief of the country, its main cities, and even the roads, with colors and threads carefully chosen to take advantage of and overcome the limitations of the printed medium. The maps is complemented by   small infographics with various data from the country.</p>

							<h4>Iguaçu River</h4>
							<p>Another example is the infographic about the Iguaçu River, for the <em>Águas do Amanhã</em> section. Occupying the entire width of a center spread – approximately 60 centimeters –, it shows several points of interest, highlighted with texts and photographs. The map was made with shapefiles provided by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE), drawn with QGIS and finished in Adobe Illustrator and Macromedia Freehand (yeah, we were kind of retro). I explored the limits of the typically limited newspaper print, taking care of tiny details.</p>

							<h4>Fazendas do Cambuhy</h4>
							<p>This work had a slightly different objective: it was a birthday present for a researcher who wrote a book about Fazendas do Cambuhy, in São Paulo. I started with photos of old maps of the region, which I vectorized manually. To give the historical tone, I chose to use old cliparts and typographic fonts that matched the aesthetics of old maps – Dalliance, by Emigré Fonts. I was satisfied by the work itself, but also because the gift meant so much to the book author.&nbsp;</p>
