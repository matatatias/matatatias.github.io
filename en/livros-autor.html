				<h1><a href='../index.html'>Matias Peruyera</a></h1>
				
				<p class="about-1">I’d call myself a graphic designer, but that would leave out many other skills in editing, writing, infographics, data visualization, typography, programming, illustration, and perhaps the main one: knowing how to identify the best resource for each situation. I absolutely love print, but I'm also fascinated with the possibilities of interactive media.</p>

												<h2>Books</h2>
						<p class="gravata">I think about books as objects, as a machine-à-lire, both to layout them as well as write them.</p>

					  <h3>The ones I wrote</h3>
                      <p>My first book arose from a call at the university center where I teach – Uninter. I saw it as an opportunity to collect all the knowledge gained from years of working in a newspaper. After the scare of the first one, others came, made without so much urgency, with more planning, and enjoying the process of research, writing and editing.</p>
						<p><em>The covers and graphic design are the responsibility of the Publisher. I only wrote them.</em></p>
							<h4>Diagramação e layout</h4>
							<img class="livro" src="livro-1.jpg" >
							<p class="texto-livro">The first book. Aimed at journalism students, it covers topics on typography, page composition, printing, among others. There are several extremely geeky print tips. <a href="https://livrariaintersaberes.com.br/produtos/diagramacao-e-layout/" target="new" >Available on the website of Editora Intersaberes</a>.</p>						
<h4>A estrutura do livro</h4>
							<img class="livro" src="livro-2.jpg" >

							<p>For the Literature course, a tribute to the craft of making book. The approach goes from the smallest to the largest: it starts with typography, goes on to the composition of paragraphs and pages, the inclusion of images, the printing processes, and ends with a chapter on electronic books, arguing that they are something with their own characteristics and that they should not simply try to emulate the print. <a href="https://livrariaintersaberes.com.br/produtos/a-estrutura-do-livro-processos-de-diagramacao-e-editoracao/" target="new">Available at Editora Intersaberes' website</a>. </p>
<h4>Laboratory of Visual Arts - Audiovisual and Animation</h4>
							<img class="livro" src="livro-3.jpg" >

							<p>What was supposed to be a one-chapter collaboration turned into a complete book. I researched audiovisual production techniques, focusing on animation. The main goal was to provide resources to teachers  to work with audiovisual and animation in elementary and high school classrooms. <a href="https://livrariaintersaberes.com.br/produtos/laboratorio-de-artes-visuais-audiovisual-e-animacao/" target="new">Available at Editora Intersaberes' website</a>.</p>
<h4>Uma história da publicidade</h4>
							<img class="livro" src="livro-4.jpg" >

							<p>Co-authored with Professor Otacílio Vaz, it is a book based on bibliographic research on the history of advertising in the world. I specifically dealt with history outside Brazil, the emergence of different copywriting and art direction techniques, the growing importance of art direction, and advertising outside the US-England axis. <a href="https://livrariaintersaberes.com.br/produtos/uma-historia-da-publicidade/" target="new">Available at Editora Intersaberes' website</a>.</p>
<h4>Teorias do jornalismo</h4>
							<img class="livro" src="livro-5.jpg" >

							<p>From a collection organized by Professor Roberto Nicolato. I wrote a chapter on Mirror Theory, based on a chapter of my master's dissertation. <a href="https://livrariaintersaberes.com.br/produtos/teorias-do-jornalismo/" target="new">Available at Editora Intersaberes' website</a>.</p>
