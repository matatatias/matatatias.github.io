				<h1><a href='../index.html'>Matias Peruyera</a></h1>
				
				<p class="about-1">I’d call myself a graphic designer, but that would leave out many other skills in editing, writing, infographics, data visualization, typography, programming, illustration, and perhaps the main one: knowing how to identify the best resource for each situation. I absolutely love print, but I'm also fascinated with the possibilities of interactive media.</p>

												<h2>Interactive projects</h2>
						<p class="gravata">Interactive projects are good opportunities to think not only about how people read, but also how they press buttons, scroll pages, interpret microcopy. Another dimension in design projects.</p>

					  <h3>How many people does your typeface reach?</h3>
					  <p>There are several typefaces available for free that do not have the various glyphs required by various languages, such as accents, specific ligatures, and other diacritics. I thought one way to encourage  typographers to finish their fonts would be to put that work in perspective, showing how many people can use the font.&nbsp;</p>
					  <p>Initially thought of as a poster, the work later turned into an interactive project, showing how many glyphs remain to be drawn to reach the speakers of a language. This makes the project a tool to control the design of a font, presents relevant information about each language, and adds an element of gamification to stimulate the production of fonts that can be used by more people.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;It's still under development. It lacks typographical refinements, checking information and curiosities, and programming the calculations, probably using Javascript and/or React.&nbsp;</p>
